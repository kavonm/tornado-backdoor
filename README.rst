A backdoor for Tornado applications
===================================

Having a Python interative interpreter running alongside you application
can come useful for debugging. This module runs a Python interactive
interpreter over a TCP connection, acting as a server, where multiple
clients can connect and which does not block the server from
handling other requests.

Source code is on `GitHub <http://github.com/saghul/tornado-backdoor>`_.

Check `backdoor.py` located in the examples directory. It will run a
backdoor server on port 1234. You can connect to it using netcat
as follows:
